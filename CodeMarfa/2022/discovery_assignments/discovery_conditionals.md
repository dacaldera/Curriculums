# DISCOVERY ASSIGNMENT 3: *Conditional Statements*
*The purpose of this is to illustrate how a random sequence of numbers (generated form the roll of a die) can be interpreted using a set of rules (aka conditional statements).*

- Begin by rolling your die 10 times, record your results in a sequence. This list is your key of actions.

- Refer to the conditional statement for your instructions for each number on your list.

- All students will begin near the closest yucca in the field outside of the trailers. Use the conditional statements provided to determine your movements and gestures.

- When youâ€™ve completed your sequence, create your own set of 20 actions (write each action on a card). Trade them with a classmate and perform them like you did in step 3.

## Action List




1: Walk 45 steps in the direction of the sun. If you reach a barrier, walk around it and continue or turn around and walk the remaining steps in the opposite direction of the barrier."

2: Shout a random word loudly into the air X number of times while looking up at the sky. X is determined by the position of this action in your list.
