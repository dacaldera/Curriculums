Here are two articles that sum up the concepts of a regenerative grazing approach and native prairie conservation:

The attached poster is simple, but effective.


Just doing a quick search, this geology article (I'm not particularly strong with geology) seems to make sense and sum things up:

Here's a timeline from UTEP

This is a blog, so I can't locate any references, but it lays out a logical history of the desert that is echoed in the previous articles:

Basically, there was a shallow sea, then a lot of uplift and volcanic activity. The rise of the Rockies and the volcanic activity diverted existing water ways, altered rain patterns, and deposited sediment that all helped create the semi-arid grasslands.
