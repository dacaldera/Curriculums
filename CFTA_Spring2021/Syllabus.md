## Coding For The Arts - ART 3396 Special Topics

Instructor: Daniel Calderon (dacaldera@gmail.com)

# Syllabus

## Course Description
In this course you will learn to program by writing your own creative software. This software will be the medium by which you can develop your own artistic ideas. You will learn languages like javascript to generate text, images, animations, and sound using the Processing coding environment as an interactive digital sketchbook. You will also learn to write HTML and CSS to embed your projects into the web for sharing. Further introduced is Arduino, the prototyping platform for creating interactive electronic objects that use motors and sensors. The aim of the course is to be an on-ramp into coding for the visual arts while teaching you algorithmic thinking: ways to conceptualize and model the world so that you can express creative ideas using computer programs.

## Objectives	
* Gain the ability to write computer code
* Be able to express artistic and creative ideas using code 
* Learn core programming structures and syntax for writing java and javascript
* Practice using the p5.js library and writing algorithms to achieve end goals
* Engage in self-learning and creative problem solving
* Learn the basics of HTML and CSS and be able to create webpages showcasing your projects
* Produce interactive content designed for digital mediums
* Learn about the arduino platform, what it is, how it is useful, and how it relates to the physical
* Be introduced to snippets about the history of computer art and artists past and present that use the digital medium as a form for expression

## Assessment 
We will have in-class exercises during most class meetings. The in-class exercises are a way for you to practice your skills in a group setting with assistance from the instructor. At the end of each week, there will be homework assigned which is to be completed and turned in by the first day of the following week. The homework is meant to help you think about coding from within your own personal headspace. Homework assignments are geared towards developing your own expressive voice using the skills and tools that we learn in class. At some point during the semester, each student will be assigned a digital artist or coding-related topic to research. Each student will give a slideshow/oral presentation on their topic to the class. The presentations are a great way to learn about a diverse range of subjects related to the field. Projects will be graded on originality, effort, demonstration of skills learned in class, and thoughtfulness. The final project is a large percent of your semester grade which will demonstrate a cumulative understanding of the core concepts that were introduced during the semester. The grading criteria for the final project will be provided on the project information sheet. 


## Roadmap
The calendar provided will be your roadmap to the topics and assignments introduced during each class. The calendar is a dynamic work in progress and will likely change as the course progresses. The instructor will review the calendar at the start of each class and any changes will be announced then. As such, it is important to attend each class and communicate with your peers about something you might have missed because of an absence. The calendar will be available online.  
## Projects
Projects will be announced as they come, and you will receive a project sheet with the guidelines and requirements for each project. To figure out how you’ll address the project’s theme, you will be asked to sketch or write out your ideas in order to communicate them to your instructor. You are to work independently on your project and any code written must be your own code. Copying and pasting code found on the internet and presenting it as your own is not permitted and is a potential plagiarism violation. Each project will be submitted in a digital format as detailed by the project sheet.

This course contains a great deal of technical, functional, and creative information and it is cumulative. **Regular attendance and active participation in the class are essential and catching up is difficult.** Come to class prepared to engage in active discussion; bring questions, feedback, and inspiration for yourself and your classmates.

## Synchronous Online Courses: 
This course is being offered in the Synchronous Online format.
Synchronous online class meetings will take place according to the class schedule. There is no
face-to-face component to this course. In between synchronous class meetings, there may also
be asynchronous activities to complete (e.g., discussion forums and assignments). This course
will have a final exam per the University schedule. The exam will be delivered in the
synchronous online format, and the specified date and time will be announced during the
course. Prior to the exam, descriptive information, such as the number and types of exam
questions, resources and collaborations that are allowed and disallowed in the process of
completing the exam, and procedures to follow if connectivity or other resource obstacles are
encountered during the exam period, may be provided.
