In class we demystefied for loops, especially nested for loops
Here is the code from the inclass demo:

```
let counter = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
  frameRate(1);
  colorMode(HSB);
}

function draw() {
  background(counter, 50, 50);
  textSize(10);

  let rect_size = 80;
  noFill();
  strokeWeight(2);
  stroke(counter, 100, 100);

  for (let j = 0; j < height; j += rect_size) {


    for (let i = 0; i < width; i += rect_size) {
      // ellipse(i, j, 3, 3);
      noStroke();
      // fill(counter + j, 50, 50);
      // rect(i, j, rect_size, rect_size);
      let rando = floor(random(0, 4));
      stroke(counter, 80, 80);
      if (rando == 0) {
        for (let k = 0; k < 2; k += 0.25) {

          arc(i, j, rect_size * k, rect_size * k, 0, HALF_PI);
        }
      } else if (rando == 1) {
        for (let k = 0; k < 2; k += 0.25) {

          arc(i + rect_size, j, rect_size * k, rect_size * k, HALF_PI, PI);
        }
      } else if (rando == 2) {
        for (let k = 0; k < 2; k += 0.25) {

          arc(i, j + rect_size, rect_size * k, rect_size * k, PI + HALF_PI, TWO_PI);
        }
      } else {
        for (let k = 0; k < 2; k += 0.25) {

          arc(i + rect_size, j + rect_size, rect_size * k, rect_size * k, PI, PI + HALF_PI);
        }
      }
      // text("(" + i + ", " + j + ")", i, j);
    }
  }


  counter += 20;
  if (counter > 360) {
    counter = 0;
  }
}
```
