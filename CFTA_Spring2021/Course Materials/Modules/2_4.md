# Module 2.4

## Custom Functions
* Custom functions are used to simplify code and to perform complex operations away from view.
* We have already been using custom functions that were written by the developers of Processing. Commands like rect() and fill() are such functions. Their operations are perfomed behind the scenes.
* We can write our own functions to use within our code sketch. 
* Custom functions are written outside the scope of the setup(){} and draw(){} loop
* Custom functions need to be declared with a return type (a keyword like void or int)
* Custom functions can take parameters that are passed through as arguments. 
* Example of a custom function that makes a smile face. 

```
void setup(){
  size(600,600);
}

void draw(){

  smiley(300,300, 200);   // call the smiley face function 

}

//declare the smiley face function
void smiley(int pos_x, int pos_y, int radius){
  ellipse(pos_x, pos_y, radius, radius);
  ellipse(pos_x-radius/4, pos_y-radius/5, radius/20, radius/20);
  ellipse(pos_x+radius/4, pos_y-radius/5, radius/20, radius/20);
  arc(pos_x, pos_y, radius/2, radius/2, 0, PI);
}
```
* We will review custom functions again in class during Module 3


## Quick code snippet for checking if mouse is within a rect
```
void setup(){
  size(600,600);
}


void draw(){
  
  fill(255,255,255); //fill default white
  
  // Checks if the the coordinates of the mouse position are within the coordinates of the rect
  // The && is equivalent to 'AND'.
  // We have 4 conditionals to check for true.
  // All 4 have to be true for the if statement code to execute.
  if( (mouseX > 200) && (mouseX < 300) && (mouseY > 200) && (mouseY < 300) ){
    
    fill(0,255,0);   // fill green
    
  }
  
  rect(200,200,100,100);  
}
```
