# Module 2.3

## While Loops
* The while loop performs the code written within the look all while the given condition is true. In other words, the while loop runs continuously until it finds that the condition is flase and then it exits.
* While loops differ from for loops in they they do not require an incrementor. Because there is no incrementor (although one could be added if desired) while loops will run an unknown number of times; however many times are needed to trigger the condition to be false.
* The structure and syntax of a while loop is very simple: `while(condition){ execution code }` 
```
while (condition to be met goes here){

  code to be executed goes here

}
```
## While loop use case
* Lets say that we want to divide the number 256 by 2 as many times as possible using a while loop. 
* Each run of the loop we'll take the number 256 and divide it by 2. We'll save this new number into a variable
* The loop will check the condition again for true/false. If true then it will repeat the loop using our number variable with the new value.
* When the number has been divided so many times by 2 that it is no longer divisible, then the condition will return false and the loop will exit. 
```
//divide the number by 2
int number = 256;  //declare our starting value outside/before the loop

  while ( number >= 2 ){  // This is our condition. As long as this is still true, execute the code inside

    number = number / 2;    // This is what we are executing, her we are dividing the number by 2 and 
                            // reassigning the value to the number variable.
                            // After this line, the value of number is half of what it was moments before.

     // here at the bottom of the execution section, the loop does not just exit, rather it checks the initial condition.
     // if the condition is true then it repeats the process. If it is false, then it really does just exit the loop

  }
```
* Note: We don't know how many times the loop will run. If we did know then we could use a for loop instead who's iterator explicitly tells it how many times to run. 
* Our for loop ran 8 times. If we change the starting number then the run count of the loop will be different. This distinguishes characteristic of a while loop is that the number of runs is uncertain.

## One infinite loop
* While loops are suceptible to getting stuck in an infinately executing loop. Remeber that the loop runs until the condition is false: if the condition is never false then the loop will run forever. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the condition will eventually trigger false. 
* We need to give the while loop a way out. An infinite loop could crash the software. 
```
int number = 2048;

while (number>=2){
 
  // number = number / 2;  // I've commented this line out, thereby making the loop infinite. 
                           // Since number is not changing (remains at 2048), the condition (number>=2) 
                           // remains true over and over and over again. 
                           // There is no way for the loop to exit, which is bad.

}

println("Hello");         // this line of code will never be reached

```
* Therefore be mindful of the condition that allows the loop to exit.
* The `break` keyword can be used to force the loop to exit at any given moment.
* In the following example, we are using a while loop to test if a random number is greater than 99. 
* Generate a random number between 0 and 100. If that number is 99 or higher, then success. If not, generate a new random number between 0 and 100 and try again.
* Keep trying by generating a new number and checking the condition until it succeeds (triggers true).  
* The chance of a random number between 0 and 100 of being 99 or higher is rather slim, therefore lets expect this loop to run multiple times (who knows how many) before succeeding. It might even never succeed which would crash the program. Bad example: 
```
float chosen_number = random(0,100);   //start with choosing a random number between 0 and 100
int loop_runs_count = 0;   //lets keep track of how many times the loop runs

while ( chosen_number <= 99 ){
 
  chosen_number = random(0,100);   // replace the old number with a newly generated random number
  
  loop_runs_count ++;  //keeping count of the number of runs

}

println("finished. Ran "+loop_runs_count+" times.");    // When the loop finally finishes, we'll print 
                                                        // out the results to the console.
```
*  **Warning, the code sketch above might crash Processing. Run at your own risk!**  If it crashes, you may need to forcibly terminate the program. On Windows: alt+ctrl+delete to get to the task manager and then find Processing in the list and "end process". On Mac, right click on the Processing icon in the dock and click "Force Quit". 
* Why might it crash? There is no way for the loop to exit. Lets add a `break` keyword and a conditional statement to check for. Good example: 
```
float chosen_number = random(0,100);   //start with choosing a random number between 0 and 100
int loop_runs_count = 0;   //lets keep track of how many times the loop runs

while ( chosen_number <= 99 ){
 
  chosen_number = random(0,100);   // replace the old number with a newly generated random number
  
  loop_runs_count ++;  //keeping count of the number of runs
  
  if ( loop_runs_count > 1000 ) {
  
    break;                        // if the loop has ran 1000 times and it still hasn't chosen a number
                                  // greater than 99, the lets just break out of the loop.
                                  // We are giving the loop an exit condition by doing this.
  }

}

println("finished. Ran "+loop_runs_count+" times.");    // When the loop finally finishes, we'll print 
                                                        // out the results to the console.
```
* This version of the while loop has an exit condition built in that prevents the loop from going infinite which protects the program from crashing.
* Also, remember to save your file before running a while loop in case it crashes. 
* Try incorporating a while loop into your own project.
