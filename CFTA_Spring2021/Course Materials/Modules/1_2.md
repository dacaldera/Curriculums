# Module 1.2
## Radians vs Degrees
* Radians is a way of measuring angles. 
* a semi-circle is PI Radians, and a full circle is TWO_PI Radians
* use the radians() function to convert angles into radians
* the arc() function's arguments requires the angle measurement to be written in radians. 
* The PI, QUARTER_PI, HALF_PI and TWO_PI constants are provided by Java and are available in processing
* an example of how arcs, radians, and PI constants are related can be seen here [Radians vs Degrees](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1076064)
* try drawing some arc segments using PI constants. 

## Curves
* curve(cpx1, cpy1, x1, y1, x2, y2, cpx2, cpy2);  //cpx1 cpy1 etc are the control points of the curve
* curveVertex(x, y); //a point that your curve will pass through, usually multiple of these are chained together with beginShape() and endShape()
* beginShape(); and endShape(); //these two functions are like the bookends of a set of shape commands
* bezier(x1, y1, cpx1, cpy1, cpx2, cpy2, x2, y2); //a smoother looking curve
* bezierVertex(cpx1, cpy1, cpx2, cpy2, x, y); //used to chain together multiple bezier curves and must be used within beginShape() and endShape(). Also requires firt point to be a normal curveVertex();
* Read this very informative article on curves here [CURVES](https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/)

## Built-in Variables
* *width* and *height* are variables that are built into processing
* The center of the canvas x-axis is width/2
* The center of the canvas y-axis is height/2
* width and height are determined by the values in the size() function
* because width and height are variables (placeholders for numbers in this case) they can be used in math operations like width-10
* try drawing a circle that is always centered and always 20 pixels away from the edge of the canvas
* *frameRate* is another built-in variable. It's value is the current frame rate of the sketch
* *frameCount* is the current frame (in an animation, this number is constantly increasing)
* use the println() to print the value of any variable to the console. 
* two more built-in variables are mouseX and mouseY (more about these next class)

## The Basic Setup
* void setup(){   } - This function runs exactly once at the beginning of the sketch
* void draw(){    } - This function runs repeatedly in a looping fashion forever until stopped
* setup and draw are special functions that are built into processing that define the sketch's structure.
* Each sketch commonly contains the setup and draw function
* The functions begins with the "void" keyword because it does not return anything (more on this in a later lesson). This keyword is required syntax
