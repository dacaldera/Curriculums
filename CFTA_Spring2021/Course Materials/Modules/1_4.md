# Module 1.4

## Did you know...
* the second(), minute(), hour(), day(), month(), and year() functions return just that which they are named for. note: they are written in singular form
* the map() function takes one value and a range and then maps it over to a new value and range. *map(0.5, 0, 1, 0, 100)* maps the value "0.5" from the range "0 to 1" into the range "0 to 100", and returns the value 50. [map() reference](https://processing.org/reference/map_.html) 

## Math with int and float variables
* number variables can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided anytime and anywhere in your sketch
* Just like in high-school math, the order of operations matter. For example 1 + 5 / 2 is different than (1 + 5) / 2. Parenthesis are used to prioritize certain operations over others. PEMDAS
* To increment a number, assign the number variable to itself plus the increment amount. For example: book_count = book_count + 1
* To increment a number by exactly 1, use the double plus-sign shortcut like this: book_count++. The same applie to subtraction.
* Another shortcut incrementation method is the "+=" operator. book_count += 5 is the same as book_count = book_count + 5. The same applies to subtraction, multiplication, and division. A large list of assignment operators can be found here: [java operator types](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_operators.asp)
* Variables can be operated on by other variables. For example:
```
int a = 20; 
int b = 30; 
int c = a * b  // The value of c is 600
```
* Math operations can be as complex as needed for your particular purpose (example:  x = ( (sqrt(some_value) * 56) / mouseX ) + height - padding ). 
* Many functions are available for operating with numbers. Functions can be included in calculations. Here are just a few examples: (a large list can be found here [java math reference](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17904_01/apirefs.1111/e12048/functmath.htm#CQLLR413) 
```
abs() //returns the positive vale of any number
sqrt() // returns the square root of a number
sq() // returns the value squared
```


## Booleans
* Boolean is a variable data type that has either a true value or a false value. 
* At the most fundamental level, a computer processor operates with purely boolean values (think 1's and 0's)
* In terms of creative coding, boolean values can be used ways including as switches, in conditional statements, and in loops.
* The integer values of 0 and 1 also can be read as boolean values of false and true respectively
* to declare a boolean variable, use the "boolean" keyword like this:
```
boolean hungry;   //declare the variable
void setup(){
  hungry = true;  // assign it a starting value
}
void draw(){
  hungry = false; // change its value anytime to either true of false;
}
```

## Comparison Operators
* Comparison operators are used to measure one value up against another value to see if one is bigger, smaller ot equal to the other.
* Some comparison operators are "<" less than, ">" greater than, "<=" less than or equal to, ">=" greater than or equal to, and "!=" not equal to.
* More importantly, the conditional operator "==" is used to check if two values are the same. NOTE: this is easily confused with the ordinary "=" equals sign wich is used *asign* a variable a value. Notice in the comparison *equal to* there are two equal signs, and in the *equals* there is one equal sign. 
* Comparison operators return a true or false value given the results of their condition. 

## Logic Operators
* Logic operators are just a few: "&&" and, "||" or, "!" not.
* && is used between two values and returns true only of both values are true.
* || is also used between two values and returns true if *at least one* of the values is true.
* They can be used in ways similar to this: 
```
boolean coffee_ready;   //declare th variable
int time;
boolean am_awake;

void setup(){
  time = 9.25;
  am_awake = true;
  coffee_ready = (time > 9.00 && am_awake == true);  // The Logic operator && is used here
  println(coffee_ready);  //prints true
}
```
* The exclamation point ! (commonly called "bang") is used to negate things. !true (can be read as "not true") is the same as false.
* The exclamation point (bang operator) can also be used to reverse or flip the boolean value of a variable: 
```
boolean glass_full = false;
void setup(){
  glass_full = !glass_full;   //flips the boolean to the opposite of what it was
}
```

## Conditional Logic
* The "if statement" is a conditional logic statement that is commonly used in code.
* If the statement that is given is true, then it performs one thing, but if the statement is false then it performs another. 
* if statements follow a very specific syntax. If the syntax is incorrect, then an error occurs and the program might fail to run. 
```
Correct "if statment" syntax

if ( conditional_statement_goes_here ) {
  //This gets executed if the statement is true
}

//this version has an else statment which runs when the if statement is not true
if ( conditional_statement_goes_here ) {
  //This gets executed if the statement is true
} else {
  //This get executed if the statement is true
}

//this version has even more: if else statements for more conditional logic
if ( conditional_statement_goes_here ) {
  //This gets executed if the statement is true
} else if ( different_conditional_statement_goes_here ){
  //This gets executed if the first statement is false but the second statement is true
} else {
  //This get executed if both of the above statements are false
}

//this version is extended even more and can be extended indefinately! You ge the idea...
if ( conditional_statement_goes_here ) {
  //This gets executed if the statement is true
} else if ( different_conditional_statement_goes_here ){
  //This gets executed if the first statement is false but the second statement is true
} else if ( different_conditional_statement_goes_here ){
  //This gets executed if the first and second statements are false but the third statement is true
} else if ( different_conditional_statement_goes_here ){
  //This gets executed if the first, second and third statements are false but the fourth statement is true
} else {
  //This get executed if all of the above statements are false
}
```
* Every opening bracket needs to have a corresponding closing bracket
* lets practice: write a sketch that draws a larger circle of a different color when clicked, depending on where the mouse is on the canvas when the click occurs
* make a ball that bounces between the borders of the canvas

## Bouncing Ball Sketch
* Here is a copy of the bouncing ball sketch we wrote in class
* If you copy and paste this code to turn in as your homework, I expect to see it full of comments explaining what each bit of code does :)
```
int loc_x = 0;
int loc_y = 0;
int size_x = 10;
int direction_x = 1;
int direction_y = 1;


void setup(){
  size(200,200);
}


void draw(){
  background(255);
  ellipse(loc_x, loc_y, size_x, size_x);
  
  if (loc_x >= width){
    direction_x = -int(random(0,5));
  } else if (loc_x <= 0){
   direction_x = int(random(0,5)); 
  }
  
  if (loc_y >= height){
   direction_y = -int(random(0,5)); 
  } else if (loc_y <= 0){
   direction_y = int(random(0,5)); 
  }
  
  loc_x += direction_x;
  loc_y += direction_y;
}
```
