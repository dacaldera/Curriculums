# Module 1.1
## The coordinate system
* Origin is located at the top left of the graph
* x increases to the right and y increases downward
* The x and y values represent the distance in number of pixels from the origin

## Primitive Shapes
* point(x,y);
* line(x_start, y_start, x_end, y_end);
* rect(x_start, y_start, width, height);
* ellipse(x_center, y_center, width, height);
* rectMode(CORNER);  // this is the default
* rectMode(CENTER);
* rectMode(CORNERS);
* ellipseMode(CENTER); // this is the default
* ellipseMode(CORNER);
* ellipseMode(CORNERS);
* triange();
* quad();
* arc();
* curve();

## Grayscale and Color
* Grayscale and color are defined using values between 0 and 255
* 0 is black and 255 is white, the numbers inbetween are shades of grey
* For colors, three values within the specified range are used, one each for red, green, and blue
* example: (255, 0, 0) represents "RED" and (0, 0, 255) represents "BLUE"

## Using Color
* fill(); // sets the color of the fill for a shape
* stroke(); // sets the color of the outline of a shape or line or point.
* if only one value is supplied, then the shape will be in grayscale
* if three values are supplied then the shape will be in color
* if two values are supplied, the first is grayscale and the second is the alpha transparency value
* if four values are supplied, then the first 3 are color values and the 4th is alpha transparency
* noStroke();
* strokeWeight();
* noFill();

## Canvas Elements
* size(width, height);
* background();

## The Processing Software Interface
* "RUN" button runs the code
* "STOP" button ends the code (good for aborting infinite loops);
* Saved code files are called "sketches" and they must be contained in a folder with the same name (happens automatically when saving)
* Sketches have a .pde file extension
* the console window is below and contains important output or supplemental information about the sketch

## Syntax
* foo(bar); // an exammple of a function name and function arguments
* all function calls end in a semicolon ";" // this is required otherwise an error will occur
* programming languages are case sensitive
* Processing will alter the color of certain words to help see the code more clearly. 
* // (two forward slashes) are used to denote a comment
* println(string); //prints to the console
* an error in the code (spelling or otherwise) will prevent the code from running and will show in the console

## The Reference
* Contains information about all of processing's built-in functions
* Reference located here: [PROCESSING REFERENCE](http://www.processing.org)
