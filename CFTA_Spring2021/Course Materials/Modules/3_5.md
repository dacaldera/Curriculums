# Module 3.5

## HTML and CSS

Here is the in-class html page that we wrote:
```
<!Doctype html>

<html>
  
  <head>
    <title>PB&J DAY!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type ="text/css" href="style.css">
    
  </head>
  <!--   -->
  
  <body>
    <h1 class="pink_text">My PB&J Page</h1>
      <p>This is a place to enjoy my love of pb&j sandwiches</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pink_text">They are yummy</li>
      <li>They are runny</li>
      <li>They are easy to make</li>
    </ul>
